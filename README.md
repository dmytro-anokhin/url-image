`URLImage` is a SwiftUI view that displays an image downloaded from provided URL. `URLImage` manages downloading remote image and caching it locally, both in memory and on disk, for you.

Using `URLImage` is dead simple:

```swift
URLImage(url: url) { image in
    image
        .resizable()
        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
}
```

Take a look at some examples in [the demo app](https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/url-image-demo).

## Features
- SwiftUI image view for remote images;
- Local image cache;
- Fully customizable including placeholder, progress indication, error, and the image view;
- Control over various download aspects for better performance.

## Installation

`URLImage` can be installed using Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.

### Using Swift Package Manager

Use the package URL to search for the `URLImage` package: https://github.com/dmytro-anokhin/url-image.

For how-to integrate package dependencies refer to [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) documentation.

### Using Cocoa Pods

Add the `URLImage` pod to your Podfile:

```rb
pod 'URLImage'
```

Refer to https://cocoapods.org for information on setup Cocoa Pods for your project.

## Usage

### Basics

`URLImage` expects URL of the image and the content view:

```swift
import URLImage // Import the package module

URLImage(url: url,
         content: { image in
             image
                 .resizable()
                 .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
         })
```

### States

`URLImage` transitions between 4 states:
- Empty state, when download has not started yet, or there is nothing to display;
- In Progress state to indicate download process;
- Failure state in case there is an error;
- Content to display the image.

Each of this states has a separate view that can be provided using closures. You can also customize certain settings, like cache policy and expiry interval, using `URLImageOptions`.

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    let url: URL
    let id: UUID

    init(url: URL, id: UUID) {
        self.url = url
        self.id = id

        formatter = NumberFormatter()
        formatter.numberStyle = .percent
    }
    
    private let formatter: NumberFormatter // Used to format download progress as percentage. Note: this is only for example, better use shared formatter to avoid creating it for every view.
    
    var body: some View {
        URLImage(url: url,
                 options: URLImageOptions(
                    identifier: id.uuidString,      // Custom identifier
                    expireAfter: 300.0,             // Expire after 5 minutes
                    cachePolicy: .returnCacheElseLoad(cacheDelay: nil, downloadDelay: 0.25) // Return cached image or download after delay 
                 ),
                 empty: {
                    Text("Nothing here")            // This view is displayed before download starts
                 },
                 inProgress: { progress -> Text in  // Display progress
                    if let progress = progress {
                        return Text(formatter.string(from: progress as NSNumber) ?? "Loading...")
                    }
                    else {
                        return Text("Loading...")
                    }
                 },
                 failure: { error, retry in         // Display error and retry button
                    VStack {
                        Text(error.localizedDescription)
                        Button("Retry", action: retry)
                    }
                 },
                 content: { image in                // Content view
                    image
                        .resizable()
                        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                 })
    }
}
```

### Image Information

You can use `init(url: URL, content: @escaping (_ image: Image, _ info: ImageInfo) -> Content)` initializer if you need information about an image, like size, or access the underlying `CGImage` object.

### Cache

`URLImage`  uses two caches:
- In memory cache for quick access;
- Local disk cache.

Downloaded images stored in user caches folder. This allows OS to take care of cleaning up files. It is also a good idea to perform manual cleanup time to time.

You can remove expired images by calling `cleanup` as a part of your startup routine. This will also remove image files from the previous `URLImage` version if you used it.

```swift
URLImageService.shared.cleanup()
```

Downloaded images expire after some time. Expired images removed in `cleanup` routine. Expiry interval can be set using `expiryInterval` property of `URLImageOptions`.

You can also remove individual or all cached images using `URLImageService`.

### Using URLCache

Alternatively you can use `URLCache`. You can configure the package globally and also per view.

```swift
URLImageService.shared.defaultOptions.cachePolicy = .useProtocol

// Download using `URLSessionDataTask` 
URLImageService.shared.defaultOptions.loadOptions.formUnion(.inMemory)

// Set your `NSURLRequest.CachePolicy`
URLImageService.shared.defaultOptions.urlRequestConfiguration.cachePolicy = .returnCacheDataElseLoad
```

Using `URLCache` adds support for Cache-Control header. As a trade-off you lose some control, like in-memory caching, download delays, expiry intervals (you get it with Cache-Control header). It also only works for in-memory downloads (using `URLSessionDataTask`).

### Options

`URLImage` allows controlling various aspects of download and cache using `URLImageOptions` structure. You can set default options using `URLImageService.shared.defaultOptions` property. Here are the main settings:

**`identifier: String?`**

By default an image is identified by its URL. Alternatively, you can provide a string identifier to override this.

**`expiryInterval: TimeInterval?`**

Time interval after which the cached image expires and can be deleted. Images are deleted as part of cleanup routine described in [Cache](#cache) paragraph.

**`maxPixelSize: CGSize?`**

Maximum size of a decoded image in pixels. If this property is not specified, the width and height of a decoded is not limited and may be as big as the image itself.

**`loadCachedAnimation: Animation?`**

Animation to apply when the image is loaded from the cache. By default, there is no animation.

**`loadFromNetworkAnimation: Animation?`**

Animation to apply when the image is loaded from the network. By default, there is no animation.

**`cachePolicy: CachePolicy`**

The cache policy controls how the image loaded from cache.

### Cache Policy

Cache policy, `URLImageOptions.CachePolicy` type, allows to specify how `URLImage` utilizes it's cache, similar to `NSURLRequest.CachePolicy`. This type also allows to specify delays for accessing disk cache and starting download.

**`returnCacheElseLoad`**
    
Return an image from cache or download it.

**`returnCacheDontLoad`**

Return an image from cache, do not download it.

**`ignoreCache`**

Ignore cached image and download remote one.

---

Some options are can be set globally using `URLImageService.shared.defaultOptions` property. Those are set by default:
- `expireAfter` to 24 hours;
- `cachePolicy` to `returnCacheElseLoad` without delays;
- `maxPixelSize` to 1000 by 1000 pixels (300 by 300 pixels for watchOS).

## Fetching an Image

You may want to download an image without a view. This is possible using the `RemoteImagePublisher` object. The `RemoteImagePublisher` can cache images for future use by the `URLImage` view.

Download an image as `CGImage` and ignore any errors:

```swift
cancellable = URLImageService.shared.remoteImagePublisher(url)
    .tryMap { $0.cgImage }
    .catch { _ in
        Just(nil)
    }
    .sink { image in
        // image is CGImage or nil
    }
```

Download multiple images as an array of `[CGImage?]`:

```swift
let publishers = urls.map { URLImageService.shared.remoteImagePublisher($0) }

cancellable = Publishers.MergeMany(publishers)
    .tryMap { $0.cgImage }
    .catch { _ in
        Just(nil)
    }
    .collect()
    .sink { images in
        // images is [CGImage?]
    }
```

When downloading image using the `RemoteImagePublisher` object all options apply as they do for the `URLImage` object. Be default downloaded image will be cached on the disk. This can speedup displaying images on later stage of your app. Also, this is currently the only supported way to display images in iOS 14 widgets.

### Download an Image in iOS 14 Widget

Unfortunately views in WidgetKit can not run asynchronous operations: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/652581. The recommended way is to load your content, including images, in `TimelineProvider`.

You can still use `URLImage` for this. The idea is that you load image in `TimelineProvider` using the `RemoteImagePublisher` object, and display it in the `URLImage` view.
